# ticTacToeCPP
Making tic-tac-toe in c++ (mulitplayer, working on an algorithm, then going to make GUI)

## How to work it
It's very simple. Plug it into a c++ compiler, or compile it using g++ or another compiler in your shell. For example 
### In the linux or mac terminal:
  cd [PATH] && g++ ticTacToe.cpp -o [ANY NAME].exe && ./[NAME].exe
  note: the ".exe" isn't required. I just do it as a habit.
### In the windows terminal:
  cd [PATH]
  g++ ticTacToe.cpp -o [any name]
  ./[name set].exe
  Note: the exe gets automatically added upon the g++ command.

## Gameplay
When you run the program, it shows you the board.
X will play first, O will play second.
The numbers on the board you see coorespond to the square. Enter the number of the square to place your X/O there.
Have fun playing!
